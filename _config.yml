description: I am a backend developer. I am based on the suncoast of the Sunshine State. 
I live in a quaint house with a large backyard and friendly neighbors, and am just a mile from the beach. See the list of technologies I’ve used and feel free to check out my projects. 
I’m also the number #1 student out of over 100,000 on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/).
