# Experience
I aspire to build beautiful software solutions for real people. I love programming. I know this because for three years I’ve been diligently studying and building projects during morning, nights and weekends—at every opportunity. I'm proud of these production ready projects. I have a strong conceptual foundation of back-end development and firm computer science fundamentals. I'm fully confident I'm ready for an entry level back-end developer position.
