# Experience
I love programming with the same passion as I hate working retail. My existence revolves around expertising in backend development like the Milky Way circles the super massive blackhole at its' center. I spend my mornings, nights and days off honing my skills by building production-ready projects and learning computer science fundamentals. The only thing I need is a chance to stop wasting time doing menial labor and instead use my cranial capacity to create beautiful backend solutions.
