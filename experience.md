# My Programming Journey:
Basically, it's been a long ten years. This year, I'm finally making the push to write code professionally. I've pushed all my chips to the middle of the table. I want to program because I enjoy programming. I feel fortunate to be alive during the Information Age because of its' opportunity.

Business is about solving people's problems. Most often, computers offer the best solution. For every job I've ever done, I've had to solve problems that should not exist because software could eliminate them or do them most efficiently. Decisions can be automated and solutions can be calibrated in milliseconds. 

I want to create programs that solve real world problems.
