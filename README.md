# Matt Skovranek
> I am a backend developer. I am based on the suncoast of the Sunshine State. I live in a quaint house with a large backyard and friendly neighbors, and am just a mile from the beach. See the list of technologies I've used and feel free to check out my projects. I'm also the number #1 student out of over 100,000 on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/afk).

## Technologies:
- Golang
- Python, Django
- JavaScript, Node
- SQL, PostgreSQL
- NeoVim
- Heroku
- Surge.sh

## Projects:
- ### [Django To-Do List Web App](https://django-todos-7caa0bc186c8.herokuapp.com/)
> A Python Django CRUD app hosted on Heroku. A double plus good to-do list. You can make an account to try it out, please use this fake email address  when registering: 'email@email.com'.
- ### [Buftermio](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/skovranek/buftermio)
> A Golang package for CLI tools. It is a cached buffer for input from your terminal. Perfect for a REPL.
